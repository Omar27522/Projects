        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>
            I'm currently learning PHP, HTML, and CSS, and this projects page serves as a showcase of my progress and experimentation with these technologies. Here, you'll find various projects that I've worked on as part of my learning journey. Each project represents a different aspect of my learning process and highlights the skills and techniques I've been exploring.
