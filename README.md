                           The system now includes a fully functional label counter for productivity tracking and comprehensive error validation for both barcodes and product information.
                              The application ensures data integrity through built-in validation systems that maintain accuracy throughout the label generation process.
                                 Enhanced user experience is achieved through an intuitive interface that includes progress indicators for batch processing and detailed label history with timestamps.
                                    The system successfully handles SKU integration and includes support for products with no-name/SKU through additional descriptors and image management.
