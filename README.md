## Projects
  [//]: <> (**Currently Working ON**: [Budget App])


  - **Project Name**: [Budget App]
  - **Description**: [A budget management application]
  - **Technologies Used**: PHP, HTML, CSS
  - **Main File**: buget app/index.php

  - **Project Name**: [ Labels ] [--Working-- and still making $Moneys$--]
  - **Description**: [A project for managing labels]
  - **Technologies Used**: PHP, HTML, CSS
  - **Main File**: labels/current/V3, in reality is release 1.0.0 but, I don't know much Python
  - **Description**: [ Labels ] Description: Labels is a specialized desktop application designed to generate product labels from CSV data.
                        The program efficiently processes bulk label creation, featuring smart product name formatting and UPC barcode generation.
                           While the application may experience processing delays during large batch operations, it maintains data integrity through built-in validation systems for both barcodes and product information.
                              The current version includes a label counter to track productivity and comprehensive error handling to prevent incorrect label generation.
                                 Future development will focus on enhancing user experience through the addition of a progress indicator for batch processing, detailed label history tracking with timestamps for daily production, and a personal productivity system for processed items.
                                    I want to be committed to making the interface more streamlined for experienced users while implementing intuitive safety measures for newcomers, ensuring mistake-free label generation.
                                       Perhaps a guest account for visitors, one for associate and lastly one for administrative accounts for the staff.
                                          Looking ahead, we plan to expand label functionality by incorporating SKU integration with additional product descriptors and images for products with no-name/SKU.
                                             And a verification system that can cross-reference physical items against digital records.
                                                These improvements will create a more robust and user-friendly labeling solution suitable for both high-volume operations and precise individual label creation.
