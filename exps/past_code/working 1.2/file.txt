I need to make a new page called data
where monthly data can be downloaded.

there is expense(index), expenses, and data.

It looks like this might be a little robust system.
more time and testing will be needed in order to rely
on this new implementation of the expense report.

Make the filters more intuitive, and easier to use.

Eventually this expense report will become the new
budget management system.

fix the data display, so that it doesn't shift when the data overflows.


Perhaps we will have the whole sheet here in no time. Purchases, GAS, Budget, Tips, LAPC, and the Bank.
good job on the financial week.
