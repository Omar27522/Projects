The label includes:

These label files can be printed directly or used in other applications as needed.
## 5. No Record Labels

Sometimes you may need to print a label quickly without recording it in your database. LabelMakerV3 provides a special "No Record Label" feature for these situations.

### When to Use No Record Labels

No Record Labels are useful when:
- You need a temporary label
- You're testing label printing
- You need a one-time label that doesn't need to be stored
- You're creating a label for an item that isn't in your regular inventory

### Creating a No Record Label

To create a No Record Label:

1. From the Welcome screen, navigate to the No Record Label section (this may be accessible through the User section or directly from the Welcome screen)

2. You'll see the No Record Label screen:

![No Record Label](/home/ubuntu/guide/images/No Record Label.jpg)

3. The No Record Label screen includes:
   - A title explaining this is for printing labels without recording them
   - A **Return** button to go back to the previous screen
   - A **Pin** option to keep the window on top
   - An **SKU** field to enter the product SKU or identifier
   - A **Mirror Print** option with color selection
   - A **Print Label** button to print the label

4. Enter the SKU or product identifier in the SKU field

5. If needed, enable Mirror Print by clicking the colored square (this is useful for certain types of printers or special label applications)

6. Click the **Print Label** button to print your label

### Mirror Printing Option

The Mirror Print option reverses the label image horizontally, which is useful for:
- Heat transfer applications
- Certain types of transparent labels
- Special printing materials that require reversed images

To use Mirror Print:
1. Click the colored square next to "Mirror Print" to enable it
2. The square will change color to indicate it's active
3. When you print the label, the image will be reversed horizontally

### Printing Without Recording

When you use the No Record Label feature, the label will be printed but no record of it will be saved in your database. This means:
- The label won't appear in your label count on the Welcome screen
- The label won't be included in any reports or exports
- The label won't be visible in the Returns Data section

This feature is designed for convenience and flexibility when you need a quick label without the overhead of recording it in your system.
