### Understanding Label Output

When you save a label, LabelMakerV3 creates a PNG image file that looks like this:

![Sample Label](/home/ubuntu/guide/images/Stainless Steel Water Bottle_200234STNWBV1Standard_label_910031470224.png)

The label includes:
- Product name at the top
- Variant/SKU information in the middle
- Barcode generated from the UPC code
- UPC number displayed below the barcode

These label files can be printed directly or used in other applications as needed.
