# LAtinosPC Website Roadmap

## Overview
This roadmap outlines the strategic plan for refactoring and improving the LAtinosPC website. The focus is on transitioning from function-based content management to a class-based architecture, improving system design, enhancing user experience, and maintaining the bilingual structure while making future adjustments more streamlined.

## Phase 1: Analysis and Planning

### 1.1 Codebase Audit
- Complete a thorough audit of the existing codebase
- Identify all functions that need to be converted to classes
- Document the current content structure and flow
- Map out the bilingual implementation mechanism

### 1.2 Architecture Design
- Design a new class-based architecture
- Create UML diagrams for the new class structure
- Define class relationships and inheritance hierarchies
- Plan for separation of concerns (MVC pattern implementation)

### 1.3 Database Review
- Analyze current data storage methods
- Design improvements for data management
- Plan for potential database normalization
- Create entity-relationship diagrams if applicable

## Phase 2: Core Refactoring

### 2.1 Create Base Classes
- Develop abstract base classes for content management
- Implement language handling classes
- Create utility classes for common functions
- Build a robust error handling system

### 2.2 Content Class Implementation
- Convert content functions to content classes
- Implement inheritance for specialized content types
- Create interfaces for standardized content methods
- Develop factory classes for content generation

### 2.3 Template System Refactoring
- Redesign the template system using OOP principles
- Create view classes for different page components
- Implement template inheritance
- Develop a more flexible rendering system

## Phase 3: Bilingual System Enhancement

### 3.1 Language Management
- Create a dedicated language management class
- Implement language switching mechanism
- Develop content localization system
- Create language-specific content repositories

### 3.2 Content Translation Framework
- Design a more intuitive translation workflow
- Implement content synchronization between languages
- Create translation management tools
- Develop automated translation verification

### 3.3 URL Structure Optimization
- Implement language prefixes in URLs
- Create language-specific routing
- Ensure proper SEO for multilingual content
- Implement language detection and redirection

## Phase 4: User Experience Improvements

### 4.1 Frontend Modernization
- Update CSS framework implementation
- Improve responsive design
- Enhance navigation for better user flow
- Optimize page load performance

### 4.2 Accessibility Enhancements
- Implement WCAG 2.1 compliance
- Add proper ARIA attributes
- Improve keyboard navigation
- Enhance screen reader compatibility

### 4.3 Interactive Elements
- Modernize form handling
- Implement AJAX for dynamic content loading
- Add interactive components where beneficial
- Improve feedback mechanisms

## Phase 5: System Integration and Testing

### 5.1 Component Integration
- Integrate all refactored components
- Ensure proper communication between classes
- Implement dependency injection where appropriate
- Create service container for class management

### 5.2 Comprehensive Testing
- Develop unit tests for all classes
- Implement integration tests
- Create automated testing pipeline
- Perform cross-browser compatibility testing

### 5.3 Performance Optimization
- Implement caching mechanisms
- Optimize database queries
- Minimize HTTP requests
- Implement asset optimization

## Phase 6: Deployment and Documentation

### 6.1 Deployment Strategy
- Create staging environment
- Develop deployment scripts
- Plan for zero-downtime deployment
- Implement version control workflow

### 6.2 Documentation
- Create comprehensive code documentation
- Develop system architecture documentation
- Create user guides for content management
- Document bilingual content workflow

### 6.3 Maintenance Plan
- Establish regular update schedule
- Create backup and recovery procedures
- Implement monitoring systems
- Develop security audit process

## Timeline
This roadmap is designed to be implemented without strict timeline constraints, allowing for flexible implementation based on resource availability and priorities. Each phase can be tackled sequentially or in parallel components can be addressed based on immediate needs.

## Success Metrics
- Improved code maintainability measured by reduced technical debt
- Enhanced developer experience for future modifications
- Faster content updates in both languages
- Improved page load times and performance metrics
- Better user engagement statistics
- Reduced time required for bilingual content management
