# Incremental Refactoring Task for Python Script

## Goal
Refactor a large Python file (welcome_window.py, ~1700 lines) into multiple smaller modules while maintaining functionality. After each module extraction, update the main file and ensure the program still works.

## Repository Information
- GitHub: https://github.com/Omar27522/Projects/blob/main/labels/current/Labels/src/ui/welcome_window.py
- Main file to refactor: welcome_window.py

## Incremental Refactoring Process

### For each module:

1. **Identify** related functions/methods to extract
2. **Create** a new file for the module
3. **Move** the related code to the new file
4. **Update** imports in the main file
5. **Test** the application after each module extraction

### Refactoring Order and Specific Tasks

#### 1. Create Utils Package (First Priority)
- Create `utils` directory with `__init__.py`
- Create these utility modules:
  - `file_utils.py`: Extract file/directory operations
  - `config_utils.py`: Extract configuration handling
  - `validation.py`: Extract validation functions

For each utils module:
- Identify file/directory handling, config, or validation functions
- Extract them into appropriate utility files
- Update imports in welcome_window.py
- Test to ensure functionality is preserved

#### 2. Create Models Package (Second Priority)
- Create `models` directory with `__init__.py`
- Create `project.py` with a `Project` class to represent project data
- Move project-related data structures and handling to this file
- Update welcome_window.py to use the Project class
- Test application

#### 3. Create Welcome Package Modules (Third Priority)
- Create `welcome` directory with `__init__.py`
- Extract these modules one by one:
  - `project_manager.py`: Extract project creation/opening logic
  - `recent_projects.py`: Extract recent projects handling
  - `dialog_handlers.py`: Extract dialog-related functionality
  - `ui_components.py`: Extract custom UI components
  - Update welcome_window.py after each extraction
  - Test application thoroughly after each step

#### 4. Refactor Main Welcome Window (Final Step)
- After all modules are extracted, refine welcome_window.py
- Keep only core window management functionality
- Connect to all the extracted modules
- Test the fully refactored application

## Specific Instructions for Each File

### file_utils.py
- Extract functions like:
  - Directory creation/validation
  - File reading/writing
  - Path manipulation
  - File extension handling

### config_utils.py
- Extract functions like:
  - Configuration loading/saving
  - Settings management
  - Default configuration handling

### project_manager.py
- Extract project-related functionality:
  - Project creation
  - Project validation
  - Project opening/loading
  - Project structure setup

### recent_projects.py
- Extract recent projects functionality:
  - Recent projects list management
  - Recent projects UI components
  - Loading/saving recent projects

### dialog_handlers.py
- Extract dialog functionality:
  - Error/warning/info dialogs
  - Confirmation dialogs
  - Input dialogs

### ui_components.py
- Extract UI component creation:
  - Header creation
  - Button groups
  - Custom widgets

## Testing Guidelines

After each module extraction:
1. Run the application
2. Verify all functionality still works
3. Test each feature related to the extracted module
4. Fix any issues before moving to the next module

## Important Considerations

- Maintain identical functionality throughout the refactoring
- Keep class/function names consistent unless they need clarification
- Add proper docstrings to new modules and functions
- Handle circular import issues by rearranging code if needed
- Use relative imports within packages
- Keep utility functions general enough to be reusable

## Final Deliverable
A functioning application with the same features but split across multiple modules in a logical package structure.
