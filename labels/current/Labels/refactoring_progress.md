   - Develop a module for common UI elements (dialog boxes, forms, etc.)
   - Standardize button creation and styling

2. **Refactor Label Window**
   - Move label window creation logic to a dedicated utility module
   - Standardize the interface with other dialog windows

### 2. File Operations Refactoring

1. **Enhance File Utilities**
   - Create more comprehensive file operation functions
   - Improve error handling and reporting

2. **Logging Improvements**

   - Create a centralized logging module

### 3. Configuration Management

1. **Improve Config Manager**
   - Enhance the configuration management system
   - Add validation for configuration settings

### 4. Testing

1. **Create Unit Tests**
   - Develop tests for the new utility functions
   - Ensure all refactored code works as expected

## Benefits of Refactoring

1. **Improved Code Organization**
   - Related functionality is now grouped together in specialized utility modules
   - Each module has a clear responsibility

2. **Enhanced Maintainability**
   - Shorter methods are easier to understand and debug
   - Common functionality is centralized, reducing duplication

3. **Better Reusability**
   - Utility functions can be used across different parts of the application
   - Consistent UI creation and behavior

4. **Preserved Functionality**
   - All existing features continue to work as before
   - Google Sheets integration, barcode handling, and settings management remain fully functional
