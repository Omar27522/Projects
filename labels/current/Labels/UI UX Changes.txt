When the Create Label window is focused, do not bring forth Welcome. Keep the Create Label window in front of all other windows like it is right now.
Make the Words Ver. at the bottom right corner clickable, an SKU window will show up, for quick label printing, only SKU needed, and save it on a quick print local text file

WELCOME WINDOW
Maybe give some metadata? like Name: Variant, SKU times stamp? 

Once the Create Label window is opened, close the Welcome window.=======> tried but did not work, had to load a backup.
Also make a setting for an alert reminder to scan it as reverse inbound [X]
 	Perhaps copy it so we can paste for now? =======> DONE!

Inside the Create Label window
	Make it possible to Ctrl and shortcuts
	Add another button that will search for a label if one is not found, make the search better than before????? I'm not sure about this one just yet.
	Add another button that will bring the Labels forth. I want to edit, but not delete entries. 
	Make the Window position itself where it last was. like, if I open it again, it opens on the left top corner of the screen.
	Tab onto the SKU, when a Tracking number is scanned.
	When no label is found, open the Management window to create one.

LABEL MAKER

Inside the View files window
	Add an extra toggle button, that will make the software transparent, and non-transparent, add it to the transparency settings
	Add an extra toggle button, that will make the software Auto print and manually print after the SKU has been inputted, add it to the  settings
	
Inside Label Maker
	Add a small toggle button next to the reset button, that will enable or disable the transparency, add it to the transparency settings

Production Testing
-Create Label does not have a minimize button, I can hide the welcome window behind it, and when I click off the welcome window loses focus, but Create label stays on top of all other windows, this is ideal for production. but I dont want to change the behavior, this is fine.
-Maybe where it says: "Label sent to printer. Ready for next label" it can be changed to the name, variant, SKU, and last of tracking number, --design it to make it fit. --
-after restarting the app the configuration is lost, but the welcome window, shows teh right config, but the google settings defaults back to the first sheet instead of the active one. XD
