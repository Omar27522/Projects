WELCOME WINDOW
Maybe give some metadata? like Name: Variant, SKU times stamp? 

Once the Create Label window is opened, close the Welcome window.=======> tried but did not work, had to load a backup.
Also make a setting for an alert reminder to scan it as reverse inbound [X]
 	Perhaps copy it so we can paste for now? =======> DONE!

Inside the Create Label window
	Make it possible to Ctrl and shortcuts
	Add another button that will search for a label if one is not found, make the search better than before????? I'M not sure about this one just yet.
	Add another button that will bring the Labels forth. I want to edit, but not delete entries. 
	Make the Window position itself where it last was. like, if I open it again, it opens on the left top corner of the screen.
	Tab onto the SKU, when a Tracking number is scanned.
	When no label is found, open the Management window to create one.
